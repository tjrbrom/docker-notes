docker run -it alpine /bin/sh
	apk update && apk add curl

(can't curl successfully, we need to install image alpine first, then install curl in there and build an image out of that)
FROM alpine
RUN apk update && apk add curl
ENTRYPOINY ["curl"]
	(tells which binary is going to be executed)
	
docker build -t mycurl .
docker run mycurl curl
	(we don't need curl at the end, cause we have the entrypoint)

docker system prune
docker run --rm mycurl www.google.com

docker login
	(credentials from dockerhub)
docker tag mycurl USERNAME/mycurl:latest
	(we now have two images)
docker push USERNAME/mycurl:latest
	(goes to the hub)
